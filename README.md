# Adventurer-s-Choice
A text adventure game that I am currently working on as I work my way through LTP3HW. 

This is still a work in progress.  I want to better understand how functions and branches work.  I am enjoying creating an interaction between the user and the program and hope to use that in more creative ways as my skills imporve.
